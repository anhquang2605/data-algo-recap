1. When comes to duplicate detection, try to use hash table, store values in arr as key, the key's value is then true or 1
2. stack and queue: ultilize "temporary data" in "order" to be efficient in data storage
3. linter is a program that make sure every line of code is syntaxtically correct 
4. computer use call stack to excute recursion
5. Use recursion when problem that has multiple sub problem and we dont know how deep it is but we know the base case, we also dont have the length or size. top down approach
